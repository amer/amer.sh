When springtime starts approaching in Berlin, I begin having conflicting feelings. On the one hand, I feel relieved the long dark winter is coming to an end. On the other, terrified by my yearly allergy season and the possibility of sneezing myself to death.

A friend of mine informed me that I could do desensitization and medical treatment for environmental allergies to alleviate my misery. While I was delighted by the news, I was intimidated by the lengthy procedure. I need to get five customized shots for five consecutive weeks and repeat the process for three years.

Nevertheless, I did the necessary allergy test and scheduled the shots. The clinic is 7 km from my place. I pulled my bike out of the storage room and headed out. The way was hilly, hillier than I expected for a flat city like Berlin. I took the first shot and waited for half an hour in the clinic if I had anaphylaxis, an acute allergic reaction that is not so nice to have, I have been told. And before I left, the doctor instructed me to keep an eye out for unusual symptoms and contact them directly if I got any.

The next day my right thumb started hurting, especially under the nail. I rationalized the pain of hitting my finger while pulling my bike out of the storage room and closed the issue. The pain subsided in two days. Next week, the same thing happened. I went to the doctor’s clinic, got my shot, waited half an hour, went back home, then my thumb started hurting again. This time I was sure that I did not hit my thumb anywhere, and the pain happened after I got the shot. This time I started thinking about probabilities. What are the chances of this event (My thumb hurts precisely the same way in the same place) after I get a desensitization shot? However, I convinced myself that it’s a rare coincidence because I’ll sound silly telling my doctor that my right thumb hurts after every shot.

One week forward, I got my third shot, but this time, I’ve asked the doctor to give me the injection in my left arm to test if my left thumb would hurt instead of the right one. I did not tell my doctor anything about the pain. But before I left the clinic, I asked the nurse casually, “What symptoms might people get after getting a desensitization shot?.” Not to my surprise, right thumb pain wasn’t on the list. The next day at home, I started having the same pain in the exact right thumb under my nail!! At that point, I made up my mind that it must be the desensitization, and I should inform my doctor.

On the fourth appointment, I told my doctor, “my right thumb hurts every time I get the shot here. Is this usual?” I observed her facial impression changing from puzzled to “Oh! Another stupid patient” back to the professional face in seconds. Then she assured me politely that she never heard, saw, or read about such phenomena. I left the clinic while reconciling with the shame that my doctor believes I’m dumb.

While cycling back home, going up the road, I got pissed off by my bicycle gear shifter; It’s just too stiff and difficult to move; it needs some oil. Here it hit me. It wasn’t the shot. It was my bike shifter all the time.

“Correlation does not imply causation, you idiot,” I told myself while wrestling with the gear shifter.
